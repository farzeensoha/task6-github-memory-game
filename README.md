Created HTML and CSS files locally for the website- a memory game.

Used Git Bash to initialize a repository, commit the files, and push them to GitHub.

Enabled GitHub Pages in the repository settings, selecting the main branch.

GitHub automatically deployed the website using the content of the repository.

Obtained the final live URL for the hosted project at https://farzeensoha.github.io/task6-github-memory-game/
